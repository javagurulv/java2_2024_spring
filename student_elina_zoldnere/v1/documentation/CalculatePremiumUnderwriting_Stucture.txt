-- Not sure where to put AgeCoefficient, CountryDefaultDayPremium, InsuranceLimitCoefficient -
   I assume they will be used in several risk calculations ... Not sure,whether they should be an interface

-- I assume that `database` will contain some raw data, but there should be also a place to store processed data
   (rates, factors etc.) that are further used in calculations. It could be `data` package in `src`.


----
The first task to implement:
MedicalRiskCalculation = CountryDefaultDayPremium * DayCount * AgeCoefficient * InsuranceLimitCoefficient.

----
public interface RiskCalculation {
    BigDecimal calculateRiskPremium(TravelCalculatePremiumRequest request);

}
----
@Component
class MedicalRiskCalculation implements RiskCalculation {

    @Autowired
    private CountryDefaultDayPremium defaultDayPremium;
    @Autowired
    private dateTimeUtil dateTimeUtil;
    @Autowired
    private AgeCoefficient ageCoefficient;
    @Autowired
    private InsuranceLimitCoefficient limitCoefficient;
    ..

    @Override
    public BigDecimal calculateRiskPremium(TravelCalculatePremiumRequest request) {
        -- logic goes here

        return result;
    }

}

-- Also have to figure out, how the class TravelCalculatePremiumUnderwritingImpl will collect total of calculated
   premiums of relevant risks, according to which risks client will choose.

   It could be streams and boolean conditions to collect premiums of relevant risks, based on whether the risk is
   selected by the client or not. Or maybe even better I could maintain a separate list or map within the
   TravelCalculatePremiumUnderwritingImpl class to keep track of selected risks and their corresponding premiums as they
   are calculated.

   Probably the most reasonable approach would be implement simple collecting solution first and refactor later, when I
   already will have few risk calculations implemented.
