Plan for Implementing Agreement Data Export Functionality

1. Business Requirements
New requirements are received to implement functionality for exporting agreement data into files.
Each agreement's data should be exported into a separate file in XML format. The data must include all fields of the
agreement, persons, risks, and calculated premiums.
The files should be generated and exported daily.

2. Implementation
    Data Extraction:
        Access the database and extract only needed agreement data.
        A good selection criteria would be a timestamp. We could update agreement entity with timestamps.

    File Generation:
        Develop a service in to handle the extraction and transformation process to XML.
        Ensure each agreement's data is written to a separate XML file.
        Implement file naming conventions to avoid conflicts and ensure easy identification.
        For example, we could use a combination of agreement UUID and timestamp (agreement_{uuid}_{timestamp}.xml).

    File Storage and Management:
        Designate a storage location for the generated XML files.
        Check if a file with the same name already exists and implement logic to avoid overwriting.

    Scheduling and Automation:
        Use the @Scheduled annotation to run the job daily.
        Ensure the job is monitored and logs are maintained for troubleshooting.

    Configuration management:
        Implement a configuration property to enable or disable the functionality.

    Testing:
        Test individual components such as data extraction, transformation, and file generation with unit testing.
        Validate that each unit correctly handles the data. Consider additional integration testing.

    Integration:
        Implement internal REST API integration for this functionality.
