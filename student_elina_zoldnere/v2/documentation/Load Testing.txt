System Load Testing

1. System performance benchmark.
    - BaseLine performance (idle system, in-memory database) - 10 ms.
    An average from 12 requests of 1 thread (12 requests in total) in 60 seconds.

    - Industry standards for simple insurance calculations - 200-500 ms.
    Based on information provided by GhatGPT.

2. System performance thresholds.
    Considering measured baseline and industry standards, following levels of average processing time are set:

    - Optimal performance =< 200 ms (20 times the baseline of 10 ms).

    - Acceptable performance 220 to 500 ms.

    - Degraded performance > 500 ms.

3. Load testing results.
3.1 REST V1, in-memory database (H2).
    Optimal performance: < 500 total requests per second.
    Acceptable performance: 500 to ... total requests per second.
    Degraded performance: > ...


3.2 REST V2, in-memory database (H2).
    Optimal performance: < 450 total requests per second.
    Acceptable performance: 450 to ... total requests per second.
    Degraded performance: > ...

The results are not very accurate, though, because as the load increases, system delays in performing calls become
more significant. This caused the total time for performing requests to significantly exceed the desired time.

Taking this into account, actual running time measurement was added, and the actual performed calls per second were
calculated. However, starting from 500 actual calls per second, the more load added, the more execution was
delayed, and the change of average processing time was minimal. Actually I could not reach more than 500-600 actual
calls per second.

3.3 REST V1, server database (MySQL).
    Optimal performance: < 200 total requests per second.
    Acceptable performance: 200 to ... total requests per second.
    Degraded performance: > ...
Total amount of 250-300 calls per second was reached.

3.4 REST V2, server database (MySQL).
    Optimal performance: < 180 total requests per second.
    Acceptable performance: 180 to ... total requests per second.
    Degraded performance: > ...
Total amount of 180-220 calls per second was reached.

3.5 Performance comparison without caching vs with caching.
    REST V2, server database (MySQL).
    20 requests of 1 thread in 20 seconds (1 request per second).

    Average processing time:
        without caching: 76 ms per request
        with caching (Spring Boot + Caffeine): 51 ms per request
