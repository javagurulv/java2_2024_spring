Travel Cancellation Risk Premium Calculation Formula
                    
Formula:
Premium = BasePremium * DestinationCoefficient * DurationCoefficient * AgeCoefficient * LimitLevelCoefficient

Components Description

BasePremium:
    This is a standard premium amount set as the starting point for the calculation.
    Example: BasePremium = €10.

DestinationCoefficient:
    This coefficient adjusts the premium based on the destination of the trip. Different destinations might have 
    different risk levels.
    Example Implementation:
        Latvia -> 1.2
        Spain -> 1.5
        Egypt -> 2.0
    Default Value: 1.0 if no specific coefficient is defined for the destination.

DurationCoefficient:
    This coefficient adjusts the premium based on the duration of the trip. Longer trips typically have higher 
    coefficients.
    Example Implementation:
        1-7 days -> 1.0
        8-14 days -> 1.2
        15-21 days -> 1.5
        22+ days -> 2.0
    Default Value: 1.0 for trips of 1-7 days.

AgeCoefficient:
    This coefficient adjusts the premium based on the age of the customer.
    Example Implementation:
        0-10 years -> 0.8
        11-17 years -> 1.0
        18-25 years -> 1.2
        26-50 years -> 1.1
        51+ years -> 1.3
    Default Value: 1.0 for the age group 11-17 years.

LimitLevelCoefficient:
    This coefficient adjusts the premium based on the total cost of the trip or the insurance coverage amount.
    Example Implementation:
        0-1000 EUR -> 1.0
        1001-3000 EUR -> 1.2
        3001-5000 EUR -> 1.5
        5001+ EUR -> 2.0
    Default Value: 1.0 for trips costing 0-1000 EUR.

Example Calculation
Assume the following scenario:

    BasePremium: €10
    Destination: Spain (DestinationCoefficient = 1.5)
    Trip Duration: 10 days (DurationCoefficient = 1.2)
    Customer Age: 30 years (AgeCoefficient = 1.1)
    Trip Cost: 4000 EUR (LimitLevelCoefficient = 1.5)

Using the formula:
Premium = BasePremium * DestinationCoefficient * DurationCoefficient * AgeCoefficient * LimitLevelCoefficient
Premium = 10 * 1.5 * 1.2 * 1.1 * 1.5 = €29.70

This means the calculated premium for this specific trip is €29.70.
